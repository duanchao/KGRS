Graph neural network (GNN) is considered as the state-of-art method for KG-based recommendation. However,
the existing GNN-based recommendation methods incorporating KG information fail to fully consider interactions between nodes in the process of message passing and aggregating, which will affect the performance
improvement of recommendation. To resolve the above limitation, we propose a Feature Interactive Graph
Neural Network for KG-based Recommendation (FIKGRec) to explicitly model sophisticated feature interactions
from the complex structure of heterogeneous knowledge graph. The overall framework consists of three
components: (1) For items, we construct item-KGs where the nodes (entities) denote items and items’ features,
and edges represent the relations between entities. Modeling feature interaction can be thus transformed into
modeling node (entity) interaction on the knowledge graph. Specifically, we integrate the collaborative signals
into the process of KG signals propagation to capture more precise user preferences and then employ the feature
entity interaction layer to incorporate the interaction information between entities in the process of neighbor
aggregation of entities in item-KG. (2) For users, a preference-aware attention mechanism is designed to obtain
the user’s fine-grained preference for items that have been interacted. (3) The final representations of users
and items are fed to deep neural network (DNN) to model complex correlations between them. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the better performance of our FIKGRec framework
compared to state-of-the-arts methods.
